<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey I'm Shahin - born and raised in London, currently working as a bus driver while making the leap into IT.
  I love finding smart ways to stretch a pound or batch-cook a week's worth of dinners.</p>
<p>When I'm not optimising routines or planning my next career move, you'll find me deep in a gaming session or binge-watching movies,
  TV shows and anime.</p>
<p>Right now I'm focused on building a flexible career that supports my family and gives me room to grow. If its practical, creative and helps me stay ahead - I'm all in.</p>
